Doggo üêï
---
The user for this application is given an image upon initialization of the website. The application allows the user to be able to not only view the dog and it's name but, features of the animal as well. The user can then select multiple features of the dog to not be shown again in future queries. Those 'banned' features will be shown in a list on the right of the page for the user to keep track of. These images are being queried by using TheDogAPI.
